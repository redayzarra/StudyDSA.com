          Tries, also known as <strong>prefix trees</strong>, are a tree-like
          data structure that allow for efficient lookup times for strings. They{" "}

          Trie operations include insertion, search, and deletion of words.
          These operations allow tries to efficiently manage words or other
          character sequences, supporting quick lookups, and prefix searches:

          <strong>represents the size of the alphabet being used</strong>.
          Essentially, it tells us how many different characters can appear in

          Each node in a trie{" "}

          references to child nodes for consecutive characters (stored in a{" "}

          node also <strong>has a flag to indicate the end of a word</strong>.

          Tries efficiently store and search words or sequences of strings. They
          are useful for tasks involving prefixes, such as autocomplete systems
          or spell checkers. To get the most out of tries in coding interviews,
          here are some essential tips and tricks:

        <ul className="ml-6">
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">&bull; Use Hash Maps:</span> When
            dealing with a large alphabet, use hash maps to store children nodes
            instead of fixed-size arrays. This improves space efficiency and
            flexibility, allowing the trie to handle any range of characters.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">
              &bull; Iterative vs. Recursive Implementations:
            </span>{" "}
            Be comfortable with both iterative and recursive implementations of
            trie operations. Recursive approaches are often more intuitive but
            can be inefficient with very deep tries. Iterative implementations,
            while sometimes more complex, can be more efficient.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">
              &bull; Handling Deletions Carefully:
            </span>{" "}
            Implement deletion operations carefully to ensure the trie remains
            consistent. After removing a word, check whether the parent nodes
            have become unnecessary (i.e., they no longer have any children and
            are not end of any word) and remove them as well.
          </li>
