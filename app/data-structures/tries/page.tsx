          Tries, also known as <strong>prefix trees</strong>, are a tree-like
          data structure that allow for efficient lookup times for strings. They{" "}

          <strong>character-by-character</strong>.

          Trie operations include insertion, search, and deletion of words.
          These operations allow tries to efficiently manage words or other
          character sequences, supporting quick lookups, and prefix searches:

          node also <strong>has a flag to indicate the end of a word</strong>.

          Inserting a word into a trie means creating a new path of nodes for

          Searching for a word in a trie checks each character of the word
          against the nodes, starting from the root. If at any point the
          required child node does not exist, or the end of the word is reached
          without matching the end of a word flag in the node, the search
          returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

          Finding prefixes in a trie is similar to searching for a whole word

          Implementing a trie involves{" "}

          <strong>boolean flag to mark the end of a word</strong>. The trie
          itself is represented by the root node, where all words are accessible
          by <strong>traversing down child nodes</strong> corresponding to
          each character in the word.

          Graphs are incredibly flexible data structures that can represent
          complex relationships which is why they are popular in coding
          interviews. Here are some essential tips and tricks for solving

            Understand the different ways of representing graphs from a given
            list of edges, such as adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.
            However, <strong>do not use an adjacency matrix</strong> for solving
            graph problems. They are really inefficient and are only used for a
            specific use-case.{" "}
            <strong>Adjacency lists are a much better option</strong> for
            representing a graph.
