          <strong>DFS for Adjacency Lists: </strong>DFS explores as far as

          using <TextLink href="/algorithms/recursion">recursion</TextLink> (or
          a stack). In adjacency lists, DFS begins at a selected node, marking
          it as visited using a{" "}
          <TextLink href="/data-structures/hashmaps#sets">hashset</TextLink>. It
          then recursively visits unvisited neighboring nodes, exploring the

          track of the order in which to visit nodes. For adjacency lists, BFS
          visits each unvisited neighbor of a node, marks it as visited, and
          adds its adjacent nodes to the queue. This process is repeated until
          the queue is empty, so that all connected nodes are visited in
          increasing distance from the starting node:

          <strong>DFS for Matrices: </strong>DFS selects an unvisited node and
          explores as far along a branch as possible, similar to the process
          with adjacency lists. However, instead of iterating over a list of
          neighbors, the algorithm checks the matrix in all four directions to
