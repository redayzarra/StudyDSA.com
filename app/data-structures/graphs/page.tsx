          Vertices are <strong>adjacent</strong> if there is an edge directly

          <strong>DFS for Adjacency Lists: </strong>DFS explores as far as
          possible along one branch before backtracking. This is implemented
          using <TextLink href="/algorithms/recursion">recursion</TextLink> (or
          a stack). In adjacency lists, DFS begins at a selected vertex, marking
          it as visited using a{" "}
          <TextLink href="/data-structures/hashmaps#sets">hashset</TextLink>. It
          then recursively visits unvisited neighboring vertices, exploring the
          graph's depth before backtracking to explore new branches:

        <p>
          <strong>BFS for Adjacency Lists: </strong>BFS explores the graph level
          by level, starting from a selected node. It uses a <TextLink href="/data-structures/queues">queue</TextLink> to keep track
          of the order in which to visit vertices. For adjacency lists, BFS
          visits each unvisited neighbor of a vertex, marks it as
          visited, and adds its adjacent vertices to the queue. This process is repeated
          until the queue is empty, so that all connected vertices are visited in
          increasing distance from the starting vertex:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock

        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>DFS for Matrices: </strong>When implementing DFS with
          adjacency matrices, the algorithm selects an unvisited vertex and
          explores as far along a branch as possible, similar to the process
          with adjacency lists. However, instead of iterating over a list of
          neighbors, the algorithm checks the matrix row corresponding to the
          current vertex for unvisited vertices to explore next.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>BFS for Matrices: </strong>BFS implementation using adjacency
          matrices also parallels that with adjacency lists, with the key
          difference being in how neighbors are identified. The algorithm
          examines the matrix row of the current vertex to find all unvisited
          vertices, marking them as visited and adding them to the queue. This
          process continues until all vertices reachable from the starting
          vertex have been explored.

          Heaps should be your go-to data structure for keeping track of{" "}
          <CodeText>k</CodeText> smallest (or largest) elements, and supporting
          operations like finding the minimum or maximum element efficiently.

            when to use a min heap or a max heap. Use a min heap when you need
            quick access to the smallest element, and a max heap for the
            largest. This decision impacts the heap's structure and the
            implementation of your solution.

          <br />
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">&bull; Heapify for Efficiency:</span>{" "}
            Whenever you're given an unsorted array that needs to be processed
            element by element according to their priority, start by converting
            it into a heap using the <CodeText>heapify</CodeText> operation.
            This is more efficient than inserting elements one by one.

            reheapify steps needed by combining both actions into a single
            operation, ideal for maintaining a heap when adding a new element
            and immediately retrieving the smallest element.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">&bull; Keeping Track of Elements:</span>{" "}
            In problems involving the <CodeText>k</CodeText> largest or smallest
