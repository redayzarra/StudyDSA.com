          Hashmaps are powered by{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">hash functions</span>, a special function
          that takes any input (regardless of its size) and produces a integer

        <p>
          This process allows hashmaps to achieve incredibly fast data retrieval
          and insertion, as it can directly access the storage location without
          needing to search through all the data.

          The hash function I've shown is a basic example of how to turn the{" "}
          <CodeText>key</CodeText> (like a name or a word) into an index that
          tells us where to store or find that key in our hashmap. It's
          important to{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">
            apply the modulo operator against the hashmap's size
          </span>{" "}
          to make sure the resulting index will fall inside our hashmap.

          A good hash function is crucial for{" "}

            spreading out keys evenly across the hashmap

          To address collisions, hashmaps use solutions like{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">chaining or open addressing</span>,
          ensuring that even when collisions occur, the data remains accessible

        <p>
          When multiple keys hash to the same index in a hashmap, we face
          collisions. Chaining is a popular and effective strategy to resolve
          these collisions. It allows multiple elements to exist at the same
          location (or "chain") by{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">linking them together in a list</span> (or{" "}
          <TextLink href="/data-structures/linked-lists">linked list</TextLink>

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Imagine a coat check at a busy theater. If two patrons happen to have
          the same ticket number, the attendant might decide to hang the coats
          together on a single hook, one behind the other. Similarly, with
          chaining,{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">
            each index in the hashmap holds a list (or "chain")
          </span>{" "}
          of entries that all hash to that index. <br />

        />
        <p>
          <br />
          When we want to insert a new key-value pair, we simply add it to the
          list at the computed index (using the hash function). To retrieve or
          delete an item, we search through the list at that index to find the
          exact key we're looking for:

        <p>
          <br />
          Chaining handles collisions by utilizing extra space, ensuring that
          the hashmap is efficient even as collisions occur. However, for
          chaining to be most effective, the{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">
            hash function should distribute keys as uniformly as possible
          </span>{" "}
          across the hashmap. This minimizes the length of chains and keeps
          operations efficient.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Let's implement a hashmap with chaining. Chaining allows us to store
          multiple entries at the same index by linking them together:

        />
        <p>
          <br />
          The <CodeText>ChainingHashMap</CodeText> class is initialized with a
          predefined size, defaulting to 10, creating an internal table as a
          list of empty lists. Each list represents a "bucket" where key-value
          pairs are stored, allowing multiple values to be stored at the same
          index, or "chaining."

        <p>
          Open addressing handles collisions in a hashmap by{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">
            finding alternative spots within the hashmap
          </span>{" "}
          for placing the new key-value pair. Unlike chaining, where collisions
          are resolved by adding elements to a list at the index,{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">
            open addressing maintains only one element at each index
          </span>
          . If a collision occurs, the hashmap looks for the next available
          slot.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock
          code={openAddressingCode}
          language="python"
          title="OpenAddressing.py"
        />
        <p>
          <br />
          There are several ways open addressing looks for indices: linear
          probing, where the table is searched sequentially; quadratic probing,
          which uses a quadratic function to find the next slot; and double
          hashing, where a second hash function determines the step size for the
          search.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now let's implement a hashmap with open addressing. Open addressing
          simply finds the next available spot for a value to be stored:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock
          code={openAddressingHashmap}
          language="python"
          title="OpenAddressing_Hashmap.py"
        />
        <p>
          <br />
          The <CodeText>find_slot</CodeText> method is crucial for the open
          addressing implementation. It begins at the index determined by the
          hash function and searches linearly (wrapping around to the beginning
          of the array if necessary) until it finds an empty slot or the slot
          where the key already exists. If it loops back to the starting index
          without finding an empty slot, it raises an exception, indicating the
          hashmap is full.

          To implement hashmaps, you need a solid understanding of collisions
          and different resolution strategies. The two primary strategies,
          chaining and open addressing, offer unique approaches to managing
          collisions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My favorite way of implementing hashmaps is chaining with{" "}
          <TextLink href="/data-structures/linked-lists">linked lists</TextLink>
          . Let's go over the code and then I'll explain why linked lists

          <span className="font-bold">
            chaining and linked lists significantly enhances efficiency
          </span>
          . Linked lists allow for dynamic space allocation, avoiding costly
          resizing operations (see{" "}

        <br />
        <p>
          They simplify collision resolution by appending new nodes to existing
          chains, ensuring <CodeText>insert</CodeText> and{" "}
          <CodeText>get</CodeText> remain efficient. The{" "}
          <CodeText>delete</CodeText> function is straightforward, we cut off
          unwanted nodes without creating gaps. This approach is scalability and
          efficient, making it a good solution for handling collisions in
          hashmaps.

        <p>
          Sets, or hash sets, are a data structure that uses hashing to store
          unique elements efficiently. Unlike hash maps, which store key-value
          pairs,{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">
            sets store individual values, ensuring no duplicates.

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          They offer fast operations for insertion, deletion, and searches,
          making them ideal for problems where duplicates are not allowed or
          when quick access is required:
        </p>
        <Operations items={setOperations} />
        <p>
          Sets can be implemented using the same method as hashmaps. By using
          chaining and linked lists, we can implement sets like this:

          At the heart of this implementation is the{" "}

          and a pointer to the next node, allowing us to create a chain of
          unique elements at each index of the hashset. The{" "}

          specified number of buckets, each starting with a dummy{" "}

          Hashmaps and sets are the most important data structures to learn if

            elements. They automatically handle duplicates and provide constant

            duplicates.

            Hashmaps are incredible when you need key-value associations. They

            Both hashmaps and sets offer constant time complexity for lookup
            operations on average, making them exceptionally efficient for
            searching for elements if you need to store them.
